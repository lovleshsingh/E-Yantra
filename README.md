Title - Pocohe - Post Covid Help

Description:
Pocohe is the abbreviation of POst COvid HElp
Team Pocohe will be developing a Web-based Application
We truly believe and trust the efforts put in by our frontline warriors and as an additional relief, we have provided solutions on a list of issues. Initially, the team will be working on the problem of a fall in several empty oxygen cylinders. Post-Covid many empty oxygen cylinders are not returned, leading to lesser cylinders to be refilled, increasing the production cost. Pocohe plays a vital role wherein a person can request pick up, using which the empty cylinders can be dropped at the correct location to be refilled and can be efficiently used and significantly reduce the production cost. Another issue that team Pocohe will be working on will be raising requests for importing extra vaccine to the locations in need so that vaccines are consumed at the right time and can be used to vaccinate the person on time and saving up production cost. Considering the cost of treatment, many family members tend to use fundraisers to generate funds for treatment. Unfortunately, this gives access to people to create fake fundraisers, and hence Pocohe playing its vital role will consist of a list of active fundraisers for which a per need to recheck or reconfirm and can donate funds without hesitation for a good cause. Additionally, creating awareness about COVID-19 and its related fungus/ infections Pocohe will also consist of an awareness page and a section for a list of available supplies. API of Covid-19 India will be used in awareness page. 
Using these ideas team Pocohe aims towards contributing their bit to COVID-19 relief
